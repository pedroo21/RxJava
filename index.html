            <blockquote>ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. RxJava
                is a Java VM implementation of ReactiveX (Reactive Extensions)</blockquote>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Software have changed dramatically in recent years. Only a few years ago a large application had tens of servers,
                seconds of response time, hours of offline maintenance and gigabytes of data. Nowadays, systems built as
                Reactive Systems are more flexible, loosely-coupled and scalable. This makes them easier to develop, liable
                to change and significantly more tolerant to failure. Reactive Systems are highly responsive, giving users
                effective interactive feedback.</p>
            <p>Back to the very beginning, what is reactive programming? Is programming with asynchronous data streams.</p>
            <p>What do we mean with "stream"? A sequence of ongoing events ordered in time: it can emit three different things:
                a value (of some type), an error, or a "completed" signal.</p>
            <p>These emitted events can only be captured asynchronously, by defining a function that will execute when a value
                is emitted, another function when an error is emitted, and another function when 'completed' is emitted -
                observers! The "listening" to the stream is called subscribing.</p>
            <p>The stream is the subject/observable being observed (Observer Design Pattern).</p>

            <p>In RxJava an object that implements the Observer interface subscribes to an object of the Observable class. Then
                that subscriber reacts to whatever item or sequence of items the Observable object emits.</p>
            <p>This pattern facilitates concurrent operations because it does not need to block while waiting for the Observable
                to emit objects, but instead it creates a sentry in the form of a subscriber that stands ready to react appropriately
                at whatever future time the Observable does so.</p>

            <h3>The Observable contract</h3>
            <p>According to <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/contract.html">The Observable Contract,</a>
                <b> an Observable communicates with its observers</b> with the following notifications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>OnNext() - transmits an item that is emitted by the Observable to the observer.</li>
                <li>OnCompleted() - indicates that the Observable has completed successfully and that it will be emitting no
                    further items.</li>
                <li>OnError() - indicates that the Observable has terminated with a specified error condition and that it will
                    be emitting no further items.</li>
                <li>OnSubscribe() (optional) - indicates that the Observable is ready to accept Request notifications from the
                    observer.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In reverse, <b>an observer communicates with its Observable</b> by means of the following notifications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subscribe - indicates that the observer is ready to receive notifications from the Observable.</li>
                <li>Unsubscribe - indicates that the observer no longer wants to receive notifications from the Observable.</li>
                <li>Request (optional) - indicates the number of additional OnNext() notifications that the observer wants from
                    the Observable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Reactive programming allows the developer to create asynchronous applications and based on a simplified form
                events. Apps nowadays have an abundance of real-time events of every kind that enable a highly interactive
                experience to the user. We need tools for properly dealing with that, and Reactive Programming is an answer.</p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Event Based Systems</h3>
            <p>You can't talk about Reactive Extensions without talking about Event-based systems.</p>
            <p>In an event-based system, individual components announce data which they wish to share with others. These other
                components may declare interest in this data feed. This is commonly called the Publish-Subscribe pattern
                (Pub-sub).</p>
            <p>This is exactly what happens when you implement with reactive extensions. In this case, our publisher (the one
                who emits data), is called the <code>Observable</code>, while the subscriber can be called the <code>Observer</code>,
                or <code>Subscriber</code>. </p>

            <hr>
            <h3 id="sec12">Filling in the Blank</h3>
            <p>Whether you call this a <strong>Publish-subscribe</strong> pattern or the <strong>Observer</strong> pattern is
                debaeable. Actually, one can be considered a concrete implementation of the other. So, to get a little deeper
                into the implementation of RXJava, let's talk a little bit about the GoF Observer pattern:</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Observer.svg/500px-Observer.svg.png" alt="Observer Patter">
                <figcaption>Figure 2 - Diagram of the GoF observer pattern.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The <i>Gang of Four</i> observer pattern describes the behavior of an object, called the Subject, which maintains
                a collection of dependents, called Observers. The subject is able to notify the observer automatically of
                any change of states that may occur, usually by calling one of their methods.</p>
            <p>Reactive Extensions extend the observer pattern, modernizing it to handle asynchronous behavior, as well as streams
                of data and/or events, instead of just a simple scalar callback.</p>
            <p>The Observable type adds two missing semantics to the GoF observer pattern:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The ability for the producer to signal to the consumer that there is no more data available (a for-each loop
                    on an Iterable completes and returns normally in such a case; an Observable calls its observer’s onCompleted() method)
                </li>
                <li>The ability for the producer to signal to the consumer that an error has occurred (an Iterable throws an
                    exception if an error takes place during iteration; an Observable calls its observer’s onError() method)</li>
            </ol>
            <p> In a brief way, Observables fill the gap by being the ideal way to access asynchronous sequences of multiple
                items.
            </p>
            <p>
                A reactive Observable can be compared to a simple <code>Iterator</code>, which is used every day by programmers
                all around the world, experienced or not.</p>
            <p>
                The dual of a pull-based Iterator is a push-based Observable. The same way that you would <code>next()</code>                on an Iterable, you <code>onNext()</code> on an Observable. The two of them can be thought about the same
                way for simplicity, however, the Observable is asynchronous, and it pushes the data on to its subscribers.
                This is how Reactive took care of the multiple item problem.</p>
            <p>
                This is the way Reactive Extensions harmonize the Iterable and Observable types for handling streams of data. What about
                asynchronous behavior?</p>
            <p>
                For asynchronicity, the JVM offers the <code>Future</code> interface, since Java 5.</p>
            <p>
                Future objects promise to hold the result of something that (maybe) hasn't occurred yet.</p>
            <p>
                RX’s main advantage over futures is that RxJava works on streams of zero or more items including never-ending streams with
                an infinite number of items. It can do so asynchronously and with little or no thread blocking. Futures,
                on the other hand, are single use. Each Future holds a single result and that's it.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The following table sums up how Observebles fit in the mix.</p>

                import java.util.List;

                public class RxJavaExample {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {

                            //create a list
                            List&lt;String&gt; list = Arrays.asList("Android", "Ubuntu", "Mac OS");

                            //Create an Observable
                            Observable&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; listObservable = Observable.just(list);  

                            //Register an Observer
                            listObservable.subscribe(new Observer&lt;List&gt;String() }

                <h5>The Strategy Pattern</h5>
                <p>
                    It is a <i>GoF</i> design pattern and belongs to Behavioural patterns since it defines a way of
                    controlling communication between classes. It's used to create an interchangeable family of algorithms
                    chosen at runtime. It allows scalability and to dynamically behave based on user preferences. RxJava used
                    in order to allow them to define their different subscriptions type and choose them at runtime based on user implementation.

                <h5>The Template Pattern</h5>
                <p>
                    Much likely a Strategy, Template method also belongs to Behavioural patterns. It differs from Strategy
                    mainly because it is used to define a basic/common algorithm and allowing the implementation of individuals to be changed,
                    while in Strategy there's no basic algorithm. Correct usage allows reduction of redundant code. RxJava used this so
                    they could define their Subject common algorithm and specialize their non common algorithms.

                    class instantiation. Thus, ensuring only one instance of a certain class is created.

                    In RxJava they, in this case, wanted to instantiate different objects based on their runtime needs. They decided to use this pattern.

                        how a system can be modeled.</p>
                    <p>These different views are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design/Logical View: The design view of a system is the structural view of the system. This gives
                            an idea of what a given system is made up of. Class diagrams and object diagrams form the design
                            view of the system.</li>
                        <li>Process View: The dynamic behavior of a system can be seen using the process view. The different
                            diagrams such as the state diagram, activity diagram, sequence diagram, and collaboration diagram
                            are used in this view.</li>
                        <li>Component View: This view shows the grouped modules of a given system modeled using the component
                            diagram.</li>
                        <li>Deployment View: The deployment diagram of UML is used to identify the deployment modules for a given
                            system.</li>
                        <li>Use case View: Finally, use case view. Use case UML diagrams are used to view a system from this
                            perspective as a set of discrete activities or transactions.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The following diagram shows the core classes of RxJava. There could be a lot more classes though they
                        are only fancy features that make RxJava a really great asynchronous stream library.</p>
                    <p>An Observable is what has the data while a Subscriber, which is a specialization of an Observer, is the
                        consumer. This connection between them is a Subscription.</p>
                    <figure>

                    <p>This sequence diagram shows what would be a developer's brief perspective while implementing RxJava in
                        his software.</p>
                    <p>After creating an Observable and a Subscriber all he has to do is subscribe the Subscriber object to
                        the Observable object. Then, magically (by triggering events), RxJava takes care of sending data
                        from the Observable to its Subscribers, while he has data.</p>

                    <p>The basic activity flow of RX Java explains a basic interaction between an Observable object and a Subscriber
                        (or a simple Observer).
                    </p>
                    <p>When a stream of data arrives, an Observable is created and that data is made available to all subscribers.
                        The observer has no knowledge of how many subscribers are listening to the data flow. Through the
                        <code>subscribe()</code> method, the Subscribers can reach the data flow, and possibly apply transformations
                        to the data.</p>
                    <p>The subscriber can unsubscribe to the data flow, and thus endind this process.</p>

                    <p>You can't talk about RX Java, or any kind of Reactive extention without talking about the Observable
                        object, represented in the center of the Component Diagram shown below.</p>
                    <p>An Observable can interact with any number of subscribers, that basicly listen to the data flow. The
                        return value of the <code>subscribe()</code> is a Subscription. This object allows you to <code>unsubscribe()</code>                        to the published events.
                    </p>
                    <p>The pub-sub communication can also be mediated through a Produces, as to control the amount of data that
                        is beeing published.</p>

            <h2>Building Large, Scalable Systems with RXJava</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>RXJava is already a proven programming technique within large enterprises, in order to develop scalable, highly concurrent systems.</p>
            <p>We studied a couple of examples, to show how these systems were able to grow and scale using this technique.</p>

                <h5>Netflix</h5>
                <p>RX Java was created by Netflix engineers, when they began to face problems related to scalability and company growth.<br>
                Netflix felt the need to completely change the architecture of their system because their API was not able to handle te large amount of requests coming from millions of devices all over the globe. <br>RX Java was developed to solve this problem, and quickly became a part of the company's development culture.

                <p>Airbnb's mobile application is constantly growing, compeling their software engineers to be in continuous update.
                RxJava became an important implementation in the Airbnb app because it simplifies the development, raising the level of abstraction around threading, that if not correctly implemented, can cause some of the most difficult bugs to debug and fix.
